We did the same with the upcoming film from La Unión de los Ríos, soon to be released on Amazon Prime. Almost all were written in English, except for one I did in Korean. We recorded and produced 15 semifinalist bands from Maravillosa Música, deploying the full potential of the studio for audiovisual projects, perhaps being the only place in the surroundings where such a magnitude of madness can be developed. We recorded music incessantly at Estudio Estudio Nakao. Dozens of artists came through: I produced songs by Juan Irio, Coneus, Niños Knoll.",

The song I'm sharing is one of the ones I'm most fond of. I put it on loop while writing this. Every day we received tracks from friends and new acquaintances who collaborated to make the album what it is. Another wonder from Juan. Tomorrow 'Blondi', Dolores Fonzi's directorial debut, premieres at the Gaumont cinema, as part of BAFICI. I made several musical tracks as part of Sounds Like a Hit Factory, including an original song that I wrote in Korean. When I say the song is in Korean, I already start hearing the police siren in my mind. Don't be bothered and enjoy. On the other hand, Trenque Lauquen by El Pampero Cine premieres today at the Lincoln Center in NY and soon in commercial theaters in the US, so other songs we made with SLAHF are playing anywhere.",

We knew there was no expectant audience and we also knew that we didn't have the tools to attract them. The priority was always to survive and for the projects to be self-sustaining. Being diluted by daily demands, Niños Knoll began to become an unfulfilled promise that over time began to weigh on us. While making this album, I felt as rarely before the obligation to finish it and show it. But we didn't arrive in due time and form. In 2019 we made some progress with Pablo, but the album seemed distant and untamable. We ended up postponing it again. During the pandemic, I went into the studio some days to see if I could deform it, find its turn. My vocals and guitars that we had rehearsed were missing, but instead I put in machines, bass, noises. I ended up disgusted, hated, and abandoned it again. At the end of 2022, we got together with @pablomatias_vidal to finish it and we were surprised to understand that the album was much closer than we thought. We were able to finish it at @nakao.estudio. A solitary, nocturnal, closed album, narrations that are machinations, with the sound of an intimate acoustic band glitched by the passage of time and the use of improper machines and plugins.",
